# Task App

The Task App implements the concepts explored in the weather app as well as adding many new ones that can be commonly found on production ready Node projects. On this project we will use a NoSQL database, mongoDB, and we will create a rest API to perform CRUD operations with the help of Mongoose. The API will include user authentication and security concepts will be implemented, as file upload to our database and sending emails. Aside from the functionality, we will also implement testing in our projec with JEST.


Application will be deployed to Heroku
