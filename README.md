# Task App

The Task-app provides the user with task manager. New task can be created and current ones can by tracked by its state.

It implements concepts explored in the weather-app as well as adding new ones that can be commonly found on production-ready Node projects. On this project we will use a NoSQL database, mongoDB, and we will create a rest API to perform CRUD operations with the help of Mongoose. The API will include user authentication and security concepts will be implemented. File uploading to our database and sending emails to help the user with the task tracking are part of the functionality too. Aside from the functionality, we will also implement testing in our project with JEST.


Application will be deployed to Heroku
